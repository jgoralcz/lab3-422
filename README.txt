This is the lab 3 for SER422 created by Joshua Goralczyk.

I use the package edu.asupoly.ser422.lab3 along with folders api, model, and services.

To begin, please run the mysql_lab3.sql file to get the database and schemas set up (I use mySQL).
Use `source <path to mysql lab here>` while in mysql
I assume that phone numbers are unique, and I have set a 10 char (integer) limit to account for area code.
If interested, you can look into the rdbm.properties file for my queries.
You may have to fiddle with the settings to connect to your mySQL in this file as well (such as password and username if yours are different).
Great! We got the database setup.
